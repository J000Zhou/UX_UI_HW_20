        <h3>Step 1. Problem</h3>
        <p>According to RSPCA Australia National Statistics 2020-2021, each year between 2015 and 2021 in Australia, an average of over <mark>63,390 animal cruelty complaints</mark> were made. </p>
        <p>RSPCA Victoria, which receives the vast majority of complaints, emphasised during consultation that their primary goal is to promote the welfare of animals, and that this is often best achieved through <mark>providing assistance and education</mark>.</p>
        <p>However, based on the previous personal experience of reporting finding an injured bird to RSPCA Victoria, the process was confusing and challenging.</p>
        <p>The goal with this project was to research, redesign, and reimagine how users experience reporting animal abuse to RSPCA Australia.
            Emphasis was on <mark>responsive web design</mark>, branding, customer journey mapping, and strategic thinking.
        </p>

            </div>

        </div>

        <p>Therefore, I conducted <mark>5 user interviews</mark> with people I know who experienced reporting lost/injured animals in Australia  before, getting to know what difficulties they’ve confronted and what they’re looking for while contacting the animal welfare services. </p>
