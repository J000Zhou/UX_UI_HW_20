                        <h4>MY ROLES</h4>
                            <p>1. Project manager </p>
                            <p>2. UX researcher</p>
                            <p>3. UX designer</p>

            </div>

            <h4>Step 1. Problem</h4>
            <p>According to RSPCA Australia National Statistics 2020-2021, each year between 2015 and 2021 in Australia, an average of over <mark>63,390 animal cruelty complaints</mark> were made. </p>

            <p>RSPCA Victoria, which receives the vast majority of complaints, emphasised during consultation that their primary goal is to promote the welfare of animals, and that this is often best achieved through <mark>providing assistance and education</mark>.</p>

            <p>However, based on the previous personal experience of reporting finding an injured bird to RSPCA Victoria, the process was confusing and challenging.</p>

            <p>The goal with this project was to research, redesign, and reimagine how users experience reporting animal abuse to RSPCA Australia.

            Emphasis was on <mark>responsive web design</mark>, branding, customer journey mapping, and strategic thinking. </p>


            <div class="grid-container-triplet">

                <div class="strategy-card bg-green rotate">
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <p>To create an online experience that will allow users to simply locate the right assistance at the right moment and to easily find support resources and information.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card bg-blue rotate">

                    <p>Introduce features developed from user research: Contact information and important support resources easy to find.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="strategy-card bg-orange rotate">
                    <h4>Goal</h4>
                    <p>How might we create an online experience that allows users to feel empowered and confident without feelings of overwhelm or frustrate?</p>
                </div>

            </div>

            <p>Therefore, I conducted <mark>5 user interviews</mark> with people I know who experienced reporting lost/injured animals in Australia  before, getting to know what difficulties they’ve confronted and what they’re looking for while contacting the animal welfare services. </p>

                <p>Our users have spent a considerable amount of time trying to <mark>locate contact information</mark> for the RSPCA website and are frustrated at the lack of prompt responses received from RSPCA.

                    <li>Adjust header photo on secondary pages to make space for the breadcrumbs.</li>
                    <li>Differentiate between primary and secondary CTA buttonss.</li>
